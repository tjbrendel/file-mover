# file-mover
An automated file mover for my movies, tv shows, and any documents that I may dump into temporary holder files.

This is a powershell script that I am currently working on to automate the process of moving my movies and tv shows from a local machine "dump" folder and organize them all onto my server. I would would also like to eventually work on a naming convention for my files so that I can move important documents as well, such as mortgage payment receipts, car payments, utility payments, etc.

Current status:
Have a working mover script for movies and TV shows, could be refined and cleaned up.

Wants:
Mover for my other files (receipts, bill payments, etc.)
Possibly a check to see if handbrake is running before running the script.
